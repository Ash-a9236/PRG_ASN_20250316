Project information :

The data structure I choose was a N-ary tree structure to better organize the data for retrival later on. The insertion
and deletion is longer but the retrieval of the data is fast since the tree has a fixed depth and the children are kept
in an arrayList, which has a complexity of O(n)

My tree has therefore an overall complexity of O(n) since each levels has the same complexity.
